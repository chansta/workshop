Bootstrap Course
================

This repository contians some source code for my quick course in bootstrapping. Using Python as the delivery language, I aim to demonstrate some basic principle in bootstrapping. 

1. bootstrap.py contains code to generate bootstrap estimate of sample mean and the variance of sample mean based on a set of iid observation. 
2. regression.py contains code to generate bootstrap etsimates and standard errors of regression coefficients using OLS.

@article{Perold1988,
abstract = {The article discusses the problems in implementing investment decisions.
Implementing investment decisions can be costly and these costs arise
in executing decisions, which is the execution cost, and in failing
to execute decisions, which is the opportunity cost. These costs
lead to a shortfall in portfolio performance. The shortfall can be
measured by managing a paper portfolio that reflects the output of
an investor's investment process, then comparing the performance
of this portfolio with that of the real portfolio. The amount of
shortfall will depend on the type of decisions the investor is trying
to implement and how good he is at implementing them. Execution costs
and opportunity costs are at opposite ends of the equation. Lowering
one generally increase the other. To reduce the shortfall, the investor
must lower one by more than he increases the other.},

Specifically, given a fixed block S̄ of shares to be executed within

sequence of trades as a function of market conditions – closed-form

@article{Sullivan2001,
abstract = {Economics is primarily a non-experimental science. Typically, we cannot
generate new data sets on which to test hypotheses independently
of the data that may have led to a particular theory. The common
practice of using the same data set to formulate and test hypotheses
introduces data-mining biases that, if not accounted for, invalidate
the assumptions underlying classical statistical inference. A striking
example of a data-driven discovery is the presence of calendar effects
in stock returns. There appears to be very substantial evidence of
systematic abnormal stock returns related to the day of the week,
the week of the month, the month of the year, the turn of the month,
holidays, and so forth. However, this evidence has largely been considered
without accounting for the intensive search preceding it. In this
paper we use 100 years of daily data and a new bootstrap procedure
that allows us to explicitly measure the distortions in statistical
inference induced by data mining. We find that although nominal p-values
for individual calendar rules are extremely significant, once evaluated
in the context of the full universe from which such rules were drawn,
calendar effects no longer remain significant. },

processes exhibit long-term persistence and antipersistence; the
dependence between observations a long time span apart decays much
more slowly with time span than is the case with the more commonly

in economics and hydrology; compared to existing models of long-term

@article{Aitken2003,
abstract = {Previous literature has adopted a broad range of measures to proxy
for market liquidity, suggesting that there is no consensus about
the most appropriate measure. The various measures used fall into
two broad categories: trade-based measures and order-based measures.
This paper reports that there is little correlation between the two.
This suggests that the choice of measure may have a significant effect
on research outcomes and therefore policy decisions. By examining
changes in these two different measurement proxies before and after
the commencement of the economic crisis on the Jakarta Stock Exchange
(JSX), this paper provides evidence that order-based measures of
liquidity provide a better proxy for liquidity. We also employ a
new measure of liquidity, which captures the bid–ask spread, the
order depth and the probability of order execution. The paper provides
evidence of the value of this type of measure in assessing the impact
of changes made to market structure. },

abstract = { An extensive synthesis is provided of the concepts, measures and
techniques of Information Theory (IT). After an axiomatic description
of the basic definitions of “information functions”, “entropy” or
uncertainty and the maximum entropy principle, the paper demonstrates
the power of IT as both an interpretive and techinically productive
tool. It is argued that this power and universality is promarily
due to the common need for (i) measures of distance and discrimination
and, (ii) appropriate partitioning- aggregation properties. IT offers
a very suggestive unification for a bewildering and arbitrary set
of approaches that have evolved in different disciplines. Applications
are discussed or indicated. These applications have relevance to
economics, finance, industrial organization, marketing, statistical
ingerence and model selection, political science and communication.
A main focus of the discussion is the generative power of IT measures
in statistical examinations of unknown distributions and random phenomena.
Measures of concentration and inequality, aggregation functions and
index numbers, tests of nested and non\_nested hypotheses, and measures
of volatility, movility and divergence are presented. Extending the
author's previous work, estimation of unknown regression functions,
densities and score functions is examined based on the maximum entropy
principle. Some empirical examples are cited. },

abstract = { This article considers the fractionally autoregressive integrated
moving average [ARFIMA(p,d,q)] models with GARCH errors. The process
generated by this model is short memory, long memory, stationary,
and nonstationary, respectively, when d ∈ (-1/2, 0), d ∈ (0, 1/2),
d ∈ (-1/2, 1/2), and d ∈ (1/2, ∞). Using a unified approach, the
local asymptotic normality of the model is established for d ∈ ∪∞j
= 0(J - 1/2, J + 1/2). The adaptivity and efficiency of the estimating
parameters are discussed. In a class of loss functions, the asymptotic
minimax bound of the estimators for the model is given when the density
f of rescaled residuals is unknown. An adaptive estimator is constructed
for the parameters in the ARFIMA part when f is symmetric, and a
general form of the efficient estimator is also constructed for all
the parameters in the ARFIMA and GARCH parts. When the density f
is unknown, Wald tests are constructed for testing the unit root
+ 1 against the class of fractional unit roots. It is shown that
these tests asymptotically follow the chi-squared distribution and
are locally most powerful. These results are new contributions to
the literature, even for the ARFIMA model with iid errors, except
for the adaptive estimator in this case with d ∈ (0, 1/2). The performance
of the asymptotic results in finite samples is examined through Monte
Carlo experiments. An application to the U.S. Consumer Price Index
inflation series is given, and a clear conclusion from this is that
the series is neither an I(0) nor an I(1), but rather than an I(d)
process with d ≈ 0.288. },

variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class
of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic
(ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero,
serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional
on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes,
the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance.
A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following
an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and
a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains
its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood
is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can
be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process,
the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based
simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This
model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in
the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated
variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

moving-average time series models with conditional heteroscedasticity,
which combines the popular generalized autoregressive conditional
heteroscedastic (GARCH) and the fractional (ARMA) models. The fractional
differencing parameter d can be greater than 1/2, thus incorporating
the important unit root case. Some sufficient conditions for stationarity,
ergodicity, and existence of higher-order moments are derived. An
algorithm for approximate maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is presented.
The asymptotic properties of ML estimators, which include consistency
and asymptotic normality, are discussed. The large-sample distributions
of the residual autocorrelations and the square-residual autocorrelations
are obtained, and two portmanteau test statistics are established
for checking model adequacy. In particular, non-stationary FARIMA(p,
d, q)-GARCH(r, s) models are also considered. Some simulation results
are reported. As an illustration, the proposed model is also applied
to the daily returns of the Hong Kong Hang Seng index (1983–1984).

The empirical results support a weak month-of-the-year effect in higher moments of stock returns. Using a complete sample of all possible combinations for each portfolio size, we show that portfolio effect varies across month of the year for both skewness and kurtosis. In particular, our results show that diversification does not necessarily provide benefits to rational investors when the stock return distribution is non-normal, even though portfolio formation can reduce standard deviation. In June, August and October, diversification across industrial sectors results in a more negatively skewed and leptokurtic return distribution, which is not preferred by investors with risk-aversion. Two (one) possible explanations for the portfolio effect on skewness (kurtosis) are also provided. Our empirical results add new evidence to the existence of anomalies in the Hong Kong stock market.

abstract = {This study examines day-of-the-week effects using hourly values of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We find that over the 1963–1983
period the weekend effect has sifted from characterizing active trading
on Monday to characterizing the non-trading weekend. Over the early
part of our sample period negative returns characterize each hour
of trading on Monday, while the return from Friday close to Monday
open is positive. In the most recent subperiod, Monday average hourly
returns after noon are all positive and the weekend effect is due
to negative average returns from Friday close to Monday open. },
